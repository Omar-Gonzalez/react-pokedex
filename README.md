# React Pokedex by Omar Gonzalez

Just a fun project I built on my free time to practice React :)

You can check the live example here: [React Pokedex](https://omar-gonzalez.github.io/react-pokedex/)

I used the excellent [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) as data feed, and [React 17](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end
